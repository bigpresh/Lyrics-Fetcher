=head1 NAME

Lyrics::Fetcher - Perl extension to manage fetchers of song lyrics.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

      use Lyrics::Fetcher;
    
      # using a specific fetcher:
      print Lyrics::Fetcher->fetch('Pink Floyd','Echoes','LyricWiki');
      
      # if you omit the fetcher, automatically tries all available fetchers:
      print Lyrics::Fetcher->fetch('Oasis', 'Cast No Shadow');
      
      # or you can pass an arrayref of fetchers you want used:
      print Lyrics::Fetcher->fetch('Oasis', 'Whatever', [qw(LyricWiki Google)]);


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is a fetcher manager. It searches for modules in the 
Lyrics::Fetcher::*  name space and registers them as available fetchers.

The fetcher modules are called by Lyrics::Fetcher and they return song's lyrics 
in plain text form.

This module calls the respective Fetcher->fetch($$) method and returns the 
result.

In case of module error the Fetchers must return undef with the error 
description in $@.

In case of problems with lyrics' fetching, the error fill be returned in the 
$Lyrics::Fetcher::Error string.  If all goes well, it will have 'OK' in it.

The fetcher selection is made by the "method" parameter passed to the fetch() 
of this module.  You can also omit this parameter, in which case all available
fetchers will be tried, or you can supply an arrayref of fetchers you'd like
to try (in order of preference).

The value of the "method" parameter must be a * part of the Lyrics::Fetcher::* 
fetcher package name. 


=head1 ADDING FETCHERS

If there's a lyrics site you'd like to see supported, raise a request as a
wishlist item on http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/Bugs.html?Dist=Lyrics-Fetcher or
mail me direct: davidp@preshweb.co.uk and, if I have time, I'll whip up a
fetcher.  Or, feel free to code it up yourself and send it to me (or upload
it to CPAN yourself) if you want to be really helpful ;)


=head1 BUGS

There are no known bugs, if you catch one please let me know.
