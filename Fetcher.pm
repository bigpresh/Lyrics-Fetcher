=head1 NAME

Lyrics::Fetcher - Perl extension to manage fetchers of song lyrics.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

      use Lyrics::Fetcher;

      print Lyrics::Fetcher->fetch("Pink Floyd","Echoes","LyricsTime");


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is a fetcher manager. It searches for modules in the 
Lyrics::Fetcher::*  name space and registers them as available fetchers.

The fetcher modules are called by Lyrics::Fetcher and they return song's lyrics 
in plain text form.

This module calls the respective Fetcher->fetch($$) method and returns the 
result.

In case of module error the Fetchers must return undef with the error 
description in $@.

In case of problems with lyrics' fetching, the error fill be returned in the 
$Lyrics::Fetcher::Error string.  If all goes well, it will have 'OK' in it.

The fetcher selection is made by the "method" parameter passed to the fetch() 
of this module.

The value of the "method" parameter must be a * part of the Lyrics::Fetcher::* 
fetcher package name.
