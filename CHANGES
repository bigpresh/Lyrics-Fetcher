$Id$

Legend:

[*] enhanced
[+] added
[-] fixed


v0.3.2, 25/02/2007 by David Precious
[-] Taken over maintainership, with kind permission of previous author
[-] Fix build scripts to avoid the test failures that have been occurring
[-] Withdrew Lyrics::Fetcher::LyricsTime from the package, as it appears that 
    www.lyricstime.com is no more (not responding, last successful access by 
    archive.org is Feb 06, so it's been out for a year :)
[-] Withdrew Lyrics::Fetcher::LyricsOnDemand from the package, as it no longer
    works - I think they've changed their site since the module was written
    (well, it was ~4 years ago!!) so it no longer works.  When I fix it, I'll
    probably re-release it in its own package, to simplify rolling out updates
    to fetchers without having to re-release the main Lyrics::Fetcher package.

As the Fetchers may need to be updated often (whenever the site they scrape
from changes) I think they should be distributed seperately from Lyrics::Fetcher,
which will not require frequent updates.

I've rolled out this version so that Lyrics::Fetcher should at least install
properly without failing tests - sometime soon I'll try to add some new features
(including the option to automatically try all available fetchers) and release
that as v0.4.0



[rather long gap in development here]
