# TODO: REALLY need to write some proper tests.
#
# The tests which were here fail because some of the Fetchers no longer work
# (unsurprisingly, they're ~ 4 years old, the sites they scrape data from have
# changed quite a bit in that time :)
#
# Also, the tests would fail if one of them didn't have a given song, or was
# temporarily unreachable, or the machine didn't have an active Internet
# connection during make test.... a whole load of reasons why tests would
# fail when they shouldn't.
#
# Therefore, to make this package pass tests for easy installation via CPAN
# (and to avoid all the fail results from cpan-testers) I've temporarily cut
# the test suite right back, ready to expand it in a future release.
#
# Since this test script wants to test just Lyrics::Fetcher rather than the
# fetchers, I can do some reliable test suites by writing a dummy fetcher
# (say, Lyrics::Fetcher::Dummy) which just returns fixed results for different
# song names, then the test suite will test solely Lyrics::Fetcher, and
# be reliable.
